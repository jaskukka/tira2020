# Data structures and algorithms course work
This is the final project in the TiRa 2020 course.
It is far from perfect, but it is what I got done.

Disclaimer! A bunch of the framework JavaFX code for the window etc. was not done by me, it was given to us at first.
So pretty much all of the image processing code is done by me, but not everything to do with the window and the buttons.
